# Indian State Boundary Extraction

This repository contains Python scripts for extracting and saving individual state boundaries from an India shapefile. The project uses the `geopandas` library for geospatial processing and `matplotlib` for visualization. It allows for cutting and saving state-wise shapefiles based on their boundaries, which can then be used in various GIS or mapping applications.

## Features

- Extracts individual state boundaries from a complete India shapefile.
- Saves each state's boundary as a separate shapefile.
- Visualizes the state boundaries using `matplotlib`.
- Allows flexibility to extract all state boundaries or just a specific state.
  
## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `geopandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `os`

To install the required libraries, you can run:

```bash
pip install geopandas matplotlib
```
